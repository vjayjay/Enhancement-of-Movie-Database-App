### Instructions:

- Upload the project on Codesandbox (https://codesandbox.io/) and submit it using the code sandbox link. This is mandatory, without this, the submission will not be accepted.
- The project must be responsive with decent CSS.
- It is not necessary that the colors should match the images above. Use your imagination and try to make it as you like.
- Pagination is required.

The goal of this enhancement project is to understand the existing <a href="https://learning.ccbp.in/question/1c277f98-14f6-4744-aad9-c1021526e442" target="_blank_">Movie Database</a> code, and add the given functionalities within the existing <a href="https://learning.ccbp.in/question/1c277f98-14f6-4744-aad9-c1021526e442" target="_blank_">Movie Database</a> code.

Your existing <a href="https://learning.ccbp.in/question/1c277f98-14f6-4744-aad9-c1021526e442" target="_blank_">Movie Database</a> app, which you have developed, allows users to view a list of movies on various pages, such as Upcoming, Popular, and Top Rated. Users can also search for any movie and view its details, including the movie's name, image, ratings, duration, genre, release date, overview, and cast.

### Enhancement Functionality
